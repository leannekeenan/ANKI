console.log(`While working at Allied Universal, I encountered a situation where a team member consistently avoided participating in mandatory 'post checks'. Despite the teams attempts to address the issue directly, the team member continued to disregard responsibilities. Seeking guidance, I discussed the matter with other team leaders, who advised me to overlook the behavior.

Realizing the impact on team cohesion, I approached the team member about their behavior, but they responded defensively and were unwilling to change. I then approached my supervisor for assistance, and while hesitant about engaging in the situation, made an announcement regarding participation expectations, and the team member began exhibiting disruptive behavior. Eventually, a solution was implemented where all team members conducted inspections in private locations. The experience taught me that if you allow a problem to persist, and leave the responsibility of fixing it to the newest members, without supporting them, reoulutions can be found but they generally are not the best option for everyone involved.`)
